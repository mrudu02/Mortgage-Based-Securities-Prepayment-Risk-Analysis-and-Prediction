# Project 1: Mortgage-Based-Securities-Prepayment-Risk-Analysis-and-Prediction

This is the project I completed during the final year of my master's, where I analyzed and predicted prepayment risks in mortgage-based securities.

* Data of 300,000 loan applications was taken from google datasets.
* The machine learning models used: Logistic Regression, Feedforward Neural Network, Gaussian Discriminant Analysis.
* Improve risk management strategies through actionable insights.
* Reduced credit risk exposure for mortgage portfolios.

Tools:
**Jupyter Notebooks**: For data analysis and modeling.
**SQL**: For data extraction and analysis.
**Power BI**: To visualize key metrics and design interactive dashboard.
